      <p>
        in a sea of despair, i called my insurance company. and then i had to call again. and then i had to call again. as a pandemic tran, i navigated one health insurance nightmare after another, almost always alone… in isolation from others as covid raged on. i felt very tiny.
      </p>
      <p>
      over time i began to branch out. i had more trans people in my life, and as i did, i noticed how our conversations about health insurance seemed to go. i noticed that when i was alone with another trans person, and when we were really connecting emotionally, that the conversation so frequently turned to our struggles with health insurance. inspired by amy berkowitz, i thought how beautiful it would be to create an art series capturing the places where two trans people talked about health insurance. i never considered that i could be the one to make it.

        then one day i drew this:
      </p>
      <img src={three} alt="a bald naked trans woman, laying on the floor. she's on the phone with the caption: well last time i called you said laser was covered."/>
      <p>
        though initially without the speech bubble or the stubble. i contemplated what someone would be saying on the phone with that look on her face. after that it all just started pouring out of me, and i made the 13 panels for the zine in about a week. i’m really delighted to be sharing this work with others. it has been exceptionally cathartic for me to make this, and i hope that some trans people who read it can find that catharsis as well.

        it was always about being seen.
